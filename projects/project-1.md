For this project we wrote the code on Java using Eclipse and implimented EZ graphics. This project is a one player game and it is controlled using the WASD keys. The goal of the game is to not let the surfer's thirst and hunger level reach to 0. There are items to keep the hunger and thirst level of the surfer above zero, which are consuming the food and drink images popping everywhere but make sure to avoid the hurricane because it decreases the level of the surfer's hunger and thirst level.

In this project, I learned how to properly use Objects and Arrays, and to initiate classes one at a time. At first, I was having some trouble implementing the actions I coded for all of the classes I made into the main program, moreover, I was not initiating my classes one at a time despite my professor telling our class to not work on everything and to take our time for each object. Though comparing this project to my first project for ICS 111, I improved a bit and I was able to run my game properly. The first time I finished this project, it felt great to know that all of the headaches I got from trying to figure out the code was not for naught and it motivated me to keep learning.
