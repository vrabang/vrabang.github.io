When we talk about patterns, people usually associate them with shapes or in art. In the software engineering world, design patterns are a solution to the common problems people face in software development. Design patterns are like constructions, we use a certain foundation to support the house or building and that repeats because that type of construction works everytime. When building a software, a task will be given and it is up to us to know what type of design pattern that will work on the project.

When thinking of design patterns, people usually figure out what design patterns to use by working on projects and assignments. A major design pattern I recall was in my class in ICS 212. Before getting on the actual coding, we have to create mockup structures by writing our code instead of coding as we go. We had to contruct what we have to create first and we were using linked lists to create a database. Our class had assignments related to our database project, therefore, by the time we had to actually code the database, the students have an idea on how to code their project. Similar to creating a house, we create a blueprint and construct the house using those plans.
