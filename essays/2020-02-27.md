## Good and Bad things about Semantic UI

My experience so far using Semantic UI are both frustrating and great. I have a little bit of experience using HTML during high school and there is a lot of typing and instead of saying, "ui menu", you make a menu tab using CSS. Even though Semantic UI is great because the result of your product is visually appealing than making websites using raw HTML/CSS. You can design responsive layouts, user interfaces that can be difficult to achieve using raw HTML/CSS. Moreover, Semantic UI is built to understand some human words, such as, columns, rows, and icons making Semantic UI more easier to use than coding raw HTML/CSS. The reason Semantic UI can be frustrating, from my perspective, is it takes time to get used to create websites, since there's different ways to create them and there are time when your code does not look like the exact replica of a original website to you have to look for the right word to use.

## HTML/CSS or Semantic UI?

When it comes to web design from my experience using HTML/CSS and Semantic UI, I think that for this modern generation Semantic UI is better than using raw HTML/CSS. When I used HTML/CSS to create a website for a project during high school, the appearance was not bad, the site was usable and fulfills all the necessities. Though comparing to some websites I recreated using Semantic UI, the appearance gave the site a modern look than what HTML/CSS could give. Though, I think the difference between coding in HTML/CSS and Semantic UI is that HTML/CSS gives the programmer more freedom than Semantic UI because there are only some things you can do with Semantic UI. However, the only thing with HTML/CSS is that is take more time to do the code compared to using Semantic UI. Both HTML/CSS and UI Frameworks have its own ups and downs, but I think that it is up to the developers on what they think is easier for them to use to create a website, for me I would choose Semantic UI because it's fast and easier to use than HTML/CSS
