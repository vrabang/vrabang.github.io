Before coming to the ICS 314, My friend who took the class told me that the class itself is not bad and that it is fun. I also heard about the WOD exercises from my friend and reassured me that it is doable within the time limit that is given. I was worried about the WODs because timed type of tests gives me so much anxiety but after everything so far I would say that the WODs helped me study or watch the screencasts earlier to prepare myself. Furthermore, the practice WODs every week helped me know what might be covered on that day and I can ask questions on anything I am unsure of to the TA. Other than learning about web application, we learned more about software engineering concepts such as Coding Standards and Agile Project Management.

## Importance of Coding Standards
In the beginning of class we were required use ESLINT after two to three weeks in the semester. 
When we talk about patterns, people usually associate them with shapes or in art. In the software engineering world, design patterns are a solution to the common problems people face in software development. Design patterns are like constructions, we use a certain foundation to support the house or building and people usually reuse some plans because that type of construction works everytime. When building a software, a task will be given and it is up to us to know what type of design pattern that will work on the project.

When thinking of design patterns, people usually figure out what design patterns to use by working on projects and assignments. One of the major design patterns used in software developments is the Singleton. Singleton was used a lot in my introductory classes for computer science, and a singleton limits the class that has a variable that can be only instanced once. This type of coding give programmers less time to implement and somewhat encourage lazy coding, but can be bad at the same time.
