Before coming to ICS 314, My friend who took the class told me that the class itself is fun and easy. I also heard about the WOD exercises from my friend and reassured me that it is doable within the time limit that is given in class. I was worried about the WODs because being timed in a test gives me anxiety, but doing several WODs, it helped me study or watch the screencasts earlier to prepare myself. Furthermore, the practice WODs every week also helped me prepare for that day and I can ask questions to the TA for clarification. Other than learning about the web application, we also learned more about software engineering concepts such as Coding Standards and Agile Project Management.

## Importance of Coding Standards
At the beginning of class, we were required to use eslint after two to three weeks in the semester. By disciplining your coding, you are making a habit of having a code that is readable for you and your teammates. A person can be great at coding, but at the same time have a messy line of codes, as a result, any person who reads their code won't be able to understand its function. Moreover, in a team, we want readable codes so that when someone needs help on any of their issues, a team member can easily find the problem. By having a coding standard, you will give less trouble to yourself and your teammates, as a result, giving you a structure that you can identify and comprehend when trying to understand its function.
