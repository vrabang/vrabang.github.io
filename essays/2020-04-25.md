In general, ethics concerns that well-being of individuals as well as society. Ethics are used everwhere and differs for every individual or group, but in the context of software engineering it is:
* Being able to act in the best interest of the public and clients.
* Produce good quality work and maintain it
* Support your peers.
* Have better judgement on your work and others.
All these can be found at the [ACM website](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) and [here](https://www.computer.org/education/code-of-ethics).
