The course, ICS 414, is a great class, I was excited to enroll in another software engineering class after taking ICS 314. The reasons I enjoyed this class was because of the team based group projects and we had an actual client who looked at our apps. I thought it will be like ICS 314 where we didn't have a client, so the objective was simple and that is to build a functioning app. I like that this class had an actual client that gave specific requirements and feedbacks for each milestones after presentations because it shows that there are different ways in updrading our applications. Furthermore, the class kind of mimicked the experience in working in a software engineering industry, the class did not only let us work on building our application but it also challenged my soft skills and how I would work with different people with different skills. 

## Brainstorming is the Key
When my group and I were first introduced to the type of application we were building, we all had no idea about carbon footprint. We all looked at the given file and had so many questions, but with enough research we were able to start making ideas on the look of the website. Despite having no knowledge about carbon footprint, we were able to create a theme and chose appropriate colors for our application with enough brainstorming as a group. Through all that talk, I thought that anything can be made as long as there are enough resources and creativity within our group. 

The hardest part in creating an app is making a customer keep using it consistently and if there is not enough interest in an app, the app would fail its purpose. Instead of thinking in a programmer's perspective we all thought of how a customer would navigate through the website and other incentives that will make them stay. My group thought of different ways in keeping future customers entertained when using our app. We thought of having them create goals and a growing tree every time they saved carbon. Furthermore, to keep the navigation simple we removed redundant pages and created pop up pages for a simple easy access in inputing and removing their data. Our website did end up quite minimalistic but pleasing to the eye, the navigation is simple and friendly to use, and we included some incentives to keep customers motivated in using the app. 

Similar to the real world or working in the Software Engineering industry, you will meet and work with different people. Not everyone is on the same level of programming skills and communication with the members is always important. My group would always meets twice a week and assign pages or task to members for every milestone. We also talked about the feedbacks we get and how to apply them in our app. I was in charged of the admin page and several other task on the back end. In the admin page a list of all the users will be shown and they can be deleted, from the admin page the cumulative data can also be seen which also accessible to the users and to the community who are curious about the app. One of the incentive we applied for the custimer was the leaf, it was one of the most challenging task that my members have implemented to the app. Applying this to the user page
