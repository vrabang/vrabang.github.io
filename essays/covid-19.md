One of the reasons I enrolled in ICS 414 was because I enjoyed the team based group projects in ICS 314. I was expecting the class to be similar to ICS 314, but one thing that was unique in this class was that we had an actual client who looked at our apps. I like that the class kind of mimicked the experience in working in a software engineering industry, moreover, the class did not only let us work on building apps but it also challenged my soft skills and how I would work with different people with different skills. 

When my group and I were first introduced to the type of app we were building, we all had no idea about carbon footprint. We all looked at the given file and had so many questions, but with enough research we were able to start making ideas on the look of the website. The hardest part in creating an app is making a customer keep using it consistently and if there is not enough interest in an app, the app would fail its purpose. Instead of thinking in a programmer's perspective we all thought of how a customer would navigate through the website and other incentives that will make them stay. My group thought of different ways in keeping future customers entertained when using our app. We thought of having them create goals and a growing tree every time they saved carbon. Furthermore, to keep the navigation simple we removed redundant pages and created pop up pages for a simple easy access in inputing and removing their data. Our website did end up very simple but pleasing to the eye, the navigation is simple and friendly to use.
