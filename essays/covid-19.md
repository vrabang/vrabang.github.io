When the new year came, all I ever thought was just a brand new year. I don't really do new year resolutions because I don't follow them and I don't understand why people are so hyped about the new year, for me it's just the year changing a number. However, even though the beginning of the year just started, a volcanic eruption happened in the Philippines. I came from the Philippines, so when I heard the news about it I was heartbroken, before that disaster an Australian wild fire was also all over the news. All the disasters just kept coming and then after Chinese New Year, an virus called Coronavirus or COVID-19 suddenly became an outbreak in Wuhan, China. Present time, the virus now was spread all over the world and almost the entire country are issued to stay home.

# Changes
I am an introverted person, so not going out is not really a problem, but walking around in school and to the bus stop are what I consider my daily exercises even though it's not much. I've never taken an online class before, so I am now experiencing that method and it is quite hard to get any motivation to do any work done. It takes me a while to start doing any assignments, but most of the time I catch up to some of my courses quite late, which I know is not good. Other than procrastinating there are tons of distractions in my house, such as video games, those distractions are also a cause for my procrastination. In some of my classes that require some social interactions, we use zoom but I don't really like it because I kinda show some of my personal space, which I find weird, but the experience is interesting. This online experience did made me realize that some classes are more interesting when I took it in-class than online and that I shouldn't do online classes at all if my time-management is not great.
