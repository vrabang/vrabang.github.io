During my senior year in high school, we had to complete a portfolio that features our plans after graduating. The students either join the military, work or go to college after high school. As I wrote my plans, my dilemma was either majoring in Computer Engineering or Computer Science. I did extensive research to differentiate the two and the simplest example I can share is that Computer Engineering focuses on both hardware and software, whereas, Computer Science mainly focuses on software. Looking back during my vex robotics career in middle school, I was introduced to artificial intelligence. In high school, I had little experience in HTML to create a website as a team and individually. From that experience, I thought and decided to major in Computer Science in college.

I love playing online games and I thought of wanting to learn game development, but then I also learned the joy of making websites. When I was researching the branches in Computer Science, Software Engineering got my attention. Being able to design software, like games or utilities on the phone or a desktop, was fascinating. Web design has always been my future aspirations as I ventured into Computer Science in college. The ability to implement your artistry in designing the website and creating the structure of the website itself helped shape my decision to become a web developer in the future.

People around me have different skill levels in programming or teamwork. Through the Software Engineering class, I hope to improve my programming and problem-solving skills. I am still learning, so I need to use every hour of free time I have to understand the concepts or lessons covered in class. I want to expand my knowledge to improve my professional portfolio, to make connections with people in the same field. Moreover, I hope to improve my soft skills because a software engineer does projects with other people and through this class, I would like to learn more about project management.
