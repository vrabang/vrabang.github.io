During my senior year in high school, we had to complete a portfolio that features our plans after graduating. The students either join the military, work or go to college after high school. As I wrote my plans, my dilemma was either majoring in Computer Engineering or Computer Science. I did extensive research to differentiate the two and the simplest example I can share is that Computer Engineering focuses on both hardware and software, whereas, Computer Science mainly focuses on software. Looking back during my vex robotics career in middle school, I was introduced to artificial intelligence. In high school, I had little experience in HTML to create a website as a team and individually. From that experience, I thought and decided to major in Computer Science in college.

I love playing online games and I thought of wanting to learn game development, but then I also learned the joy of making websites. When I was researching the branches in Computer Science, Software Engineering got my attention. Being able to design software, like games or utilities on the phone or a desktop, was fascinating. Web design has always been my future aspirations as I ventured into Computer Science in college. The ability to implement your artistry in designing the website and creating the structure of the website itself helped shape my decision to become a web developer in the future.

People around me have different skill levels in programming or teamwork. Through the Software Engineering class, I hope to improve my programming and problem-solving skills. I am still learning, so I need to use every hour of free time I have to understand the concepts or lessons covered in class. I want to expand my knowledge to improve my professional portfolio, to make connections with people in the same field. Moreover, I hope to improve my soft skills because a software engineer does projects with other people and through this class, I would like to learn more about project management.

Ever since I first grasped a paintbrush, I’ve always been eager to learn about design. Design is such a complex concept. For example, when looking at abstract art, its meaning can be completely different for different people. It motivates a person to think thoughtfully and has the potential to submerge them in a sea of imagination. It’s that special relationship between the viewer and the art that makes something as technical as software engineering interesting to me.

I never used to think that design and technology went hand in hand.  Thus, learning about software engineering and the role of design has been incredibly interesting to me. Design, implementation, and management are just some of the many things I wish to learn more about. Good art, in a way, makes a person question it. They become joined in the idea of visualization – where captivation meets inspiration.

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.
