# Overview
*The problem:* Almost everyone uses movies or TV shows to wind down when they are not hitting the books. Most students have a hard time finding friends on campus with similar tastes in entertainment, with only a couple of icebreakers that they may or may not have in their classes to get to know their peers. Maybe they need to rant/debate with someone who has watched the new episode of whatever they are currently binging. 

*The solution:* A social hub for UH Manoa students where they can meet and interact with people with similar interests in movies/TV shows and note down shows/movies they have watched for others to see. This can also be used as a way for clubs and organizations to gauge students’ tastes in movies/entertainment so that it can be used for their own events, such as movie nights or mixers.

#Approach
There are two roles, being an admin role and a user role. Students must register with their UH email, and go through the process of entering their name, major, year, a bio, and three genres that they like. After registering/logging in, users are able to look at other users profiles and lists of movies/TV shows that they like or are currently watching. Users can also comment on the person’s profile page to recommend movies or comment on their movie/TV list. Admins are allowed to ban users who break site rules or harm other users, (i.e. harassing, threatening, use of racial, sexual slurs), as well as to announce movie-related events happening on campus. 

# Mockup page ideas
Landing page
Home page
User profile page
Admin page
Add/Edit movie/TV show entry page
Page that recommends users for you to talk to based on similar interests

# Case ideas
User enters landing page, is prompted to log in, logs in, enters home page, and sets up their profile
If the user does not have an account, is prompted to create an account, choose at least three genres as an introduction, enters home page.
Admin enters landing page, prompted to log, logs in, and will be given complete access to the site.
User is able to browse other users’ pages which will include a list of genres they like, their favorite movies, a list of movies that they had logged down/seen recently, and their rating
User can comment on other users’ profiles


# Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
A page that displays video projects (film/animation/etc) from students across campus to promote their work
Suggestion page for movies to watch that clubs/organizations can use for events around campus (ASUH movie nights, RIOs, etc)
Allow students to rate each other’s reviews
A page that randomly recommends a movie/TV show for the user to watch every day based on the genres that they had chosen when they had signed up
