## Overview
*The problem:* Almost everyone uses movies or TV shows to wind down when they are not hitting the books. Most students have a hard time finding friends with similar tastes in entertainment, with only a couple of icebreakers  . Classes tend to have different people every semester and interactions are only at a certain level.

*The solution:* A social hub for UH Manoa students where they can meet people with similar interests in movies/TV shows and note down shows/movies they have watched for others to see.

## Mockup page ideas
Landing page
Home page
User profile page
Admin page
Add/Edit movie/TV show entry page
A page that randomly recommends a movie/TV show for the user to watch every day
Page that recommends users for you to talk to based on similar interests

## Case ideas
User enters landing page, is prompted to log in, logs in, enters home page, and sets up their profile
If the user does not have an account, is prompted to create an account, choose at least three genres as an introduction, enters home page.
Admin enters landing page, prompted to log, logs in, and will be given complete access to the site.
User is able to browse other users’ pages which will include a list of genres they like, their favorite movies, a list of movies that they had logged down/seen recently, and their rating


## Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
A page that displays video projects (film/animation/etc) from students across campus to promote their work
Suggestion page for movies to watch that clubs/organizations can use for events around campus (ASUH movie nights, RIOs, etc)
Allow students to review movies, and allow students to rate each other’s reviews
