## Why Should We Care?

Ever since I entered the Computer Science major, one of the things that my professor does not fail to mention is coding standards. They emphasize the importance of having a readable code because nowadays, coding involves being in a group of people working on the same project. If people are not able to read your code, then the time you used to fix or explain your intention could've been used towards the project. Moreover, when we write code and try to run it, we would often run on a problem, in most cases the problem can be fixed by either adding a semicolon, curly brackets or a parenthesis.

Furthermore, implementing the coding standards early as you code will be a benefit. You'll improve the quality of your code making you stand out from people who has no discipline on their code. Your code will also look clean making it easier to identify the problems on your code. When we try to learn a programming language, if you use the "coding standard", you'll see how you structure your program and understand your intention or how the code will work.

## The Green Checkmark

Using ESlint on the first week was great, seeing the green checkmark gives me a relief and satisfaction. It gives you the location of the syntax problem, giving me a clean code. It's a great way to get used to writing code with the standards in mind, though, I don't wanna I hope to fix those problems by myself instead of relying on ESlint. I might get programs that are not compatible with ESlint, so fixing those problem by yourself is also helpful.
